### Interview 1 - [Jos] [8/9/25]

1. Push the button, phone goes off parks anywhere, asks whats up
2. Load, unload (what they come to load?)
    - So if a truck driver comes to load stuff from a certain department, to know exactly which department to move them to
3. Preferably outside until they know who they are (there's almost no control as to who comes in)
4. On the phone, and when they need extra info on how to load etc they have to call the corresponding office
5. average of 25
6. Yes, mostly same transporter company (sometimes 5-6 times a day)
7. A lot, so also there's need for that, especially for R&D
8. The drivers are acting as middlemen between the incoming people and the offices WHILE driving
    - misplaced responsibility
    - dangerous while driving heavy machinery
9. Just having to redirect people
10. A lot of drivers who don't speak the language, especially eastern european
11. Google translate
12. Less middle-communication: if a driver/trucker needs to see someone from a certain department, no more rerouting thru the drivers
13. No rerouting people!!!

#### Follow up questions

1. Who would be the main user of the app? Would it still be the drivers, or only the office staff?
    - Drivers -> the application then needs to consider that these people are constantly busy/driving heavy machinery
2. Will the drivers still need to have control of the gates, or ideally would that be relegated to other people? / Will there be a designated middleman person?
    - No, just the drivers
3. Map out all possible routes (ie. truck comes to load stuff -> gets sent to designated loading bay -- truck comes to unload -> gets sent to another place -- technician comes to R&D, etc)
4. Do we also need some way to integrate maps/directions?
    - Ideally yes, especially for drivers that need to go to another entrance/warehouse

### Interview 2 - [Jason] [8/9/25]

1. People come in, no control (so just open gate, no prior control)
2. The correct address where they need to go (there are a couple of Marel places, so the correct warehouse). If they come to load or unload.
3. No answer
4. No communication
5. No answer
6. A lot of regular drivers
7. A lot of people coming in who are not truck drivers (many Marel employees as well)
8. If the person with the phone doesn't open quick, there's a lot of delays and queuing (there is only ONE phone with the app installed)
9. No designated parking areas/no signs
10. A lot of people who don't speak the language
11. Try english, if not contact office
12. No answer
13. People that come for loading -> know exactly WHAT they come to load

## Revised Questions

1. What information do you need from drivers?
2. Are there cases when you don't know where to send the driver/you need to communicate with the office?
3. How many are "regulars" vs. new drivers? Are there a lot of regulars?
4. How often do you need to let in visitors/technicians or people who aren't drivers?
5. What is the most frustrating part of the current system?
6. If you could change one thing about the current process, what would it be?
7. What would make your job easier when handling incoming drivers?

### Interview 3 - [Sjef] [10/9/25]

1. Whether they are loading OR unloading, if unloading, what company they come from/what cargo they have
2. Didn't ask
3. A lot of visitors are regulars that already know what to do
4. A lot of visitors that aren't related to the warehouse (R&D mainly)
5. Language is main issue. Second issue is audio-related issues due to environment noise (ie truck engines)
6. The phone constantly ringing
7. When theyre unloading give extra info about cargo so the operators know where to send them

#### Extra info

Simple phone notifications might not be heard. Phone calls are better for noisy environment.

### Interview 4 - [Antwon] [10/9/25]

1. Loading or unloading, company/cargo
2. Not really, maybe if they need to load something but not frequently
3. A lot of regular drivers that already know what to do
4. A lot of cars coming in for other departments/visitors/etc
5. If it's very busy, no one knows where to park or where to go. There are no signs outside designating parking spots.
6. No audio communication would be better. So only text communication with instant translation
7. [no concrete answer]
