# Project Objectives

Communication between entrance gate and office to manage site access.

## User Requirements

1. **Control Gate Access**: Open gate for visitors
2. **Communicate with office**: ? still not sure if user needs to talk to the office before opening

## Functional Requirements

1. **Information Display**: Show on-site rules and safety instructions to visitors
2. **Driver Registration Form**: Where visitors provide required details
3. **Office Response Form**: Where staff reviews and responds to drivers
4. **Multi-language Support**: Find out main languages and/or intregration with automatic translator
5. **Gate Opening System Integration**
6. **Bypass Option**: Allow direct entry for other visitor categories

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Driver Database**: Database with incoming/outgoing drivers for analysis
2. **Gate Opening Log**: for analysis/logging purposes

Doubting:

- **Scheduled Deliveries**: Allow User to schedule deliveries or visits (are there enough scheduled deliveries to take into scope?)
- **Recurring Driver Profile**: "Profiles" for recurrent drivers (so that they don't have to fill in form every time) (will drivers be willing to make profiles? how do i authenticate them after without account creation etc???)

## Out of Scope

1. Communication with office? if it needs to be done it might not be through the same application
2. Full-scale testing.
